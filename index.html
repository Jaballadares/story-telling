      <p class="fifty">Me: I imagine us having these big windows (ideally with a view)...maybe in a loft or something... and up against these windows we would have a really long table. A table that is maybe twice the size of your dining room table. And at the table we would have two chairs. One - maybe on the right side - for you  (for that would afford me with a generous view of my favorite beauty mark on my favorite face) and one on the left side for me. And of course our chairs would have wheels on them so we could slide down the length of the table to plant a nimble kiss on the cheek or for quick access to brainstorming/sharing sessions..</p>
